# Nebul0us

Continuation of the **Nebulous.io** hack: Official bots made by **Nyaanity**.

## How to use these bots?

This is a private project which is "not avaibale to the public".
To use this,
you must purchase a license inside our Discord server https://discord.gg/YjnAQq3BRN.
We also have a tutorial on how to set the bots up on there.

## Where is the code?

The code is located inside the **./build** folder.
It is heavily obfuscated to protect against code stealing or licence bypassing.
You may purchase the code by messaging the owner of our Discord server **Nyaanity#0001**.
