### How to use these bots?

To use this,
you must purchase a license inside our Discord server (https://discord.gg/YjnAQq3BRN).
Please message the owner of the Discord server **Nyaanity#0001** to buy.

### Why do I have to pay for this?

No one is offering the bots for public use but us.
We're offering you bots that can easily ruin lobbies,
that can farm plasma **MULTIPLE TIMES THE WORTH YOU PAY FOR THE BOTS** (speaking about millions of plasma),
easily dominate leaderboards
and may save you a lot of time farming XP.
We wish to at least have our work paid off if we're gonna let others use it.

### If I buy it, can my friend use it too?

Yes.
Once you've purchased a license,
you can invite a friend and they will receive a license too,
for free.

### How do I set the bots up if I have access?

### Where do I download the bots?

Once you've purchased a license,
you will be given a special role (**VIP**) inside our discord server (https://discord.gg/YjnAQq3BRN)
that will give you permission to our **#download** channel.
Inside there is a download link of the bot file.

### Can I try the bots out before buying (or have them for free? "plz i'm famous")?

No.
You can't use the bots before you buy a license.
We can never know who you are or if you're just a moderator trying to simp for cute Greg.
**Buy it or leave it.**
We don't care about what music u produce or how many followers u have on ur lame ass instagram account (speaking from experience).
