# Nebul0us

Continuation of the **Nebulous.io** hack: Official bots made by **Nyaanity**.

# QNA

### How to use these bots?

To use this,
you must purchase a license inside our Discord server https://discord.gg/YjnAQq3BRN.
We also have a tutorial on how to set the bots up on there.

### Why do I have to pay for this?

No one is offering the bots for public use but us.
We're offering you bots that can easily ruin public lobbies,
that can farm plasma **MULTIPLE TIMES THE WORTH YOU PAY FOR THE BOTS** (speaking about millions of plasma),
and may save you a lot of time farming XP.
We wish to at least have our work paid off if we're gonna let others use it.

### Where is the code?

The code is located inside the **./build** folder.
It is heavily obfuscated to protect against code stealing or licence bypassing.
You may purchase the code by messaging the owner of our Discord server **Nyaanity#0001** (https://discord.gg/YjnAQq3BRN).

### If I buy it, can my friend use it too?

No.
The script is HWID-bound,
means that you can't simply share between devices.
