### Commands

###### co

    Connect the bots to the server.

    This does not require friendship with the target player ID,
    but requires them to set their visibility to Online.

###### en

    Enters or re-enters the game.

###### rj

    Rejoin the current lobby.
    Also useful if the bots were kicked from the lobby.

###### de

    Desync the bots.
    Force disconnection from the server and stop sending/receiving network packets.

###### es <player name | player id>

    Give some emotional support to the player and feed them.
    Most fun in FFAU.

###### tf

    Toggle farming plasma.

###### qu

###### ch <message>

    Send an in-game chat request.

###### em <index: 0-89>

###### nom <max spectators> <max players> <enabled: y/N>

    Detects e.g. unwanted spectates and instantly disconnects.
    Mods can force spectates ("force internal spectate"),
    even when inside a hidden lobby.

    Temporarily suspend moderator prevention if you're trying to join the lobby.
